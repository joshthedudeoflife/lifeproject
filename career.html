	As a recent graduate of StartUp Institute I have worked in Ruby, Node.JS and Objective C.  I worked on a partner company project for Ovuline building a food saftey app.  I also took part in a 24 hour hackathon and learned how to work in a start up environment.
	<br>
	<br>
	In 2013 I worked at Hatfield media as a film editor and website developer.  Recent projects included an annual convention for Pet Supplies Plus, music videos at the Louisville venue Headliners and hopefully will be filming some of the up and coming
	Tech companies in the area.  We are about to launch a new site in a few weeks which I will be working on in detail with material I have learned in this class. We also built a prototype for an iOS app.
